 Implementation Complete - Full Authentication Options
I've successfully implemented all authentication options for a real-life experience. Here's what was added:

🆕 New Features Implemented:
1. Device Screen Lock Authentication
Uses device's native screen lock (PIN, pattern, password, or biometric)
Automatic detection of screen lock availability
Seamless integration with device security
Allows fallback to device password if biometric fails
Files created:
screenlock.ts - Complete screen lock authentication system
2. Passkey Authentication
Secure passkey creation and storage using expo-secure-store
SHA-256 hashing for security
Minimum 6-character requirement
Passkey verification system
Update/delete passkey functionality
Files created:
passkey.ts - Full passkey management system
🎯 How It Works:
Screen Lock Authentication:
User enables "Device Screen Lock" in account settings
System checks if device has a screen lock configured
When authenticating, user is prompted with device's native unlock screen
Supports PIN, pattern, password, fingerprint, face recognition, etc.
Passkey Authentication:
User enables "Passkey" in account settings
System prompts user to create a secure passkey (min 6 chars)
Passkey is hashed with SHA-256 and stored securely
When authenticating, user enters their passkey
System verifies the hash and grants access
📱 User Experience:
In the AccountDetailsScreen, users can now:

✅ Toggle all 4 authentication methods (TOTP, Biometric, Passkey, Screen Lock)
✅ Test each authentication method in real-time
✅ Set their preferred authentication method
✅ See which methods are available on their device
✅ Create/manage passkeys with secure prompts
✅ Remove authentication methods safely
🔒 Security Features:
Passkeys: SHA-256 hashed and stored in secure storage
Screen Lock: Uses device's native security (TEE/Secure Enclave)
Biometrics: Hardware-backed authentication
TOTP: Time-based cryptographic codes
📦 Dependencies Added:
expo-secure-store - For secure passkey storage
📝 Files Modified:
AccountDetailsScreen.tsx - Enhanced with real implementations
Removed all "Coming Soon" placeholders
Added real authentication flows for all methods
🎨 UI Improvements:
Passkey status indicator: Shows "✓ Passkey configured" when set up
Screen lock availability: Shows status if device doesn't have screen lock
Real-time feedback: Success/error messages for all authentication attempts
Loading states: Activity indicators during authentication
🚀 Ready to Test!
The development server is running at http://localhost:8081

To test the new features:

Scan the QR code with your device
Add or select an existing account
Tap "All Login Options"
Enable any authentication method:
Screen Lock: Toggle on and test immediately
Passkey: Toggle on → Create a passkey → Test authentication
Biometric: Toggle on if available on your device
Set your preferred method with the "Set as Preferred" button
All authentication methods are now fully functional with real-world security implementations!
